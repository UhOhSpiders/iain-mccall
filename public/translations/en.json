        "I'm a software developer based in Glasgow, Scotland.",
        "I developed a love for technology while working in animation and video production. I became so interested in the software that I was using that I decided to start making it instead. I am fascinated by design patterns and full stack architectures, as well as modern front end frameworks like React. I enjoy bringing my project management and soft skills to new software development challenges.",
